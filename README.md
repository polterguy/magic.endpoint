[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.endpoint.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.endpoint)

Magic endpoint is a dynamic Hyperlambda endpoint controller, allowing you to declare endpoints as Hyperlambda
files for your ASP.NET Web apps.

## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://servergardens.com/buy/).
Notice, 7 days after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
